/*
Project to make sure I know basics of bubble sort. Probably not terribly important
since it's so inefficient.

Algorithm description: iterate through container, comparing adjacent values and 
swapping them if they're in the wrong order. Iterate as many times as necessary
until sorted (no more swaps necessary).

Unique features of bubble sort:
1. Efficient if array is almost already sorted, or entirely sorted.

Time complexity:
Avg: O(n^2)
Worst: O(n^2)
Best: O(n)

Space complexity:
Worst: O(1)
